(Thomas, G. G., & Wagiu, E. (2019). ALUMNI TRACER STUDY SYSTEM DESIGN USING WEB-BASED GPS (CASE STUDY OF UNIVERSITAS ADVENT INDONESIA). Abstract Proceedings International Scholars Conference, 7(1), 1826-1841. https://doi.org/10.35974/isc.v7i1.2006 ) Graduate is one of the important support in the development of a university. Graduate have a role to assist universities in developing the university into the community through collaboration in academic terms. (2019-12-18 ).
A new online system was made to help universities track their graduates' locations, making it easier to find out where they are now. This system aims to solve the difficulties of keeping track of alumni.

Alumni are the most important asset of any educational institutions, its support in the development of a university. They are the peoples who represents the colleges or universities organizations in real world. The development of alumni tracer management system is a software designed to traces alumni employment and status of the graduates and manage the relationships between an institution and its graduates. This system will serve as a centralized database repository for storing and managing of the whereabouts, the jobs and the other information’s of the graduates including contact details that might be helpful in tracing and reports requirements needed by the school institutions. It is necessary for university to stay connected with their graduates to determine their life path or movement. itry to inclujde references/ citations to some statements to support eaadch statement for the 1st paragraph until the 3rd paragraph
Many educational institutions struggle to maintain a connection of their alumni. Graduates may become disconnected due to changes in their personal circumstances, such as relocation or career shifts and family obligations. Since they currently live in modern society where digital innovates and technology is always with us. The educational institutions must adapt the modern technology to enhance alumni engagement. Living in this modern era where people continue to rely on technology to stay connected, informed and entertained as well as to perform tasks more efficiently. Developing an alumni tracer management system presents an opportunity for educational institutions to keep in touch the graduates. This web applications very important not only for the graduates but for the administrations as well. It can easily simplify and lighten our works in many different ways. In this modern era, people often use technology to do things faster and make the tasks easier.
The implementation of the “Development of Alumni Tracer Management System” is a web application aimed to monitor the institution graduates and stay connected, informed about relevant events and initiatives. Through the “Development of Alumni Tracer Management System” alumni will have the opportunity to establish connections with their peers who have also graduated from the institutions. This encourages a community among graduates, enabling them to ask for assistance, exchange expertise, and build meaningful connections. Not just for the graduates but also for the administration, that allows the university to track the students who have graduated. The administration can communicate with their alumni using this technology to keep them informed about the university’s latest news, as well as invite graduates to participate in upcoming events.
The Development of Alumni Tracer Management System is an important project for the university, aiming to establish a comprehensive web application to effectively monitor and engage with the graduates. With this web application will enable graduates to maintain communication and stay updated on relevant events and initiatives in school. It also allows alumni to connect with others who graduated from the same institutions. In addition to helping alumni, the system provides significant advantages for the administration, allowing them to efficiently track graduated students and connect with alumni. The administration can invite alumni to participate in upcoming activities and notify them of the latest news from the university through push notifications. This initiative is a living example of the dedication to build lasting connections with the graduates and providing them with the support and resources they need.


Statement of the Problem
 Tracing the graduates and sending of survey forms is also a problem. The administration struggles to keep alumni informed about their employment status. Despite efforts to reach out all the graduates quarterly, some alumni do not respond. The lack of responsiveness from certain alumni to administrative notifications asking for the latest information on graduate’s employment status, making it difficult for the administration to stay informed about the graduate’s employment status. Specifically, the present study seeks to answer the following questions:
1.What is the current process used by the planning office of the university in terms of managing its alumni ‘s employability data and records?
2.What is the level of difficulty encountered by Central Philippines State University Planning Office and its personnel of different campuses in terms of;
a.Notification of alumni student to fill-up employability tracer form.
b.Con
c.solidation of employability of the alumni students per campuses.
d.Representation of percentage pf employed students.
3.What are the technical requirements needed in the Development of Alumni Tracer Management System?
4.How efficient and effective is the development of Alumni Tracer Management System?

Objectives 

	A web-based online application for alumni, entitled “Development of Alumni Tracer Management System” that the main objectives is to keep alumni linked to the institution while also allowing the administrations to keep track of them. This is the only option to maintain contact with the former students. More specifically, this study aimed to create database system to keep all the files of the alumni.
Specifically, this project aims to:
1.To maintain the long-term record of all the college graduates.
2.To properly manage the information ‘s of the alumni.
3.To immediately notify the alumni about the school news, events and other activities through push notification.
4.To keep track of the employment status of the alumni.
5.Analyze well the scope of your study/ system to capacitate all the objectives that can be met by your system.l

Significance of the Study

	The result of the study will help the university to stay connected with its alumni and intended to improve the tracker system of the school. It saves time and efforts of the school to track the alumni. This project study will benefit the following:
The CPSU Administration. This study will help university administrations especially the Planning’s Office in tracking alumni whereabouts and can easily informed if there’s a school related event. 
The Alumni. The students will be able to easily update their employment status and to keep track with the school events and activities.
Future Researchers. This study will serve as relative information for other researchers and will aid them in developing their own online applications and creating their own version of the Alumni Tracer for future use.

Scope and limitations

This capstone project entitled “Development of Alumni Tracer Management System” is focused on the development of an application in managing and accessing alumni data, which is important for maintaining connections with former students. Only monitoring alumni activity, handle data, and enhance contact between the university and its graduates. It creates simple interfaces for alumni to update their information easily. This system is only available to the graduates of Central Philippines State University Campuses. Student will not be able to utilize the system because it contains confidential information. Specify the scope and limitations of collecting alumnis data. Also state that this system is capable of consolidating all alumnis data of each campus of CPSU
